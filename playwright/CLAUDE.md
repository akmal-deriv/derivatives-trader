## [CRITICAL] Skills — Auto-Loading

Load the matching skill immediately when the trigger is detected — before reading files, exploring the app, or writing any code.

| Trigger                                                                                 | Skill                                     |

## [CRITICAL] Project Structure

- All Playwright files live under `playwright/` — **NEVER** at the project root
- **Tests**: `playwright/tests/[feature]/[name].spec.ts`
- **Pages**: `playwright/pages/[Name]Page.ts`
- **Utils**: `playwright/utils/` — import from `../utils` (barrel export via `index.ts`)
- **Fixtures**: `playwright/fixtures/fixtures.ts` — **always import `test` from here, NEVER from `@playwright/test`**
- **Flows (docs)**: `playwright/flows/[feature]/` — catalog, coverage, spec per feature
- **Config**: `playwright.config.ts` at project root
- **Output**: `playwright/test-results/` (gitignored)
- **Env files**: `playwright/.env.staging` and `playwright/.env.production` (gitignored)

### [CRITICAL] Test Folder Naming — Must Mirror App Route Structure

When creating a **new test folder** under `playwright/tests/`, the folder name **MUST mirror the corresponding feature area** in the app.

| Feature area                  | `playwright/tests/` folder        |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Login / authentication        | `playwright/tests/auth/`          |
| Trade form + contract details | `playwright/tests/trade/`         |
| Open positions                | `playwright/tests/positions/`     |
| Reports (P&L, statement)      | `playwright/tests/reports/`       |
| Notifications                 | `playwright/tests/notifications/` |

**Rule**: Before creating a new folder, confirm the matching feature module exists in `packages/trader/src/` or `packages/core/src/`. Never invent a folder name with no app counterpart.

---

## [CRITICAL] Auth Flow

derivatives-trader uses the **Deriv OAuth / login page flow**:

1. Navigate to `process.env.LOGIN_URL` — Deriv login page
2. Enter email and password
3. Redirects back to the trading app

**For full login in tests**: use `loginPage.login()` — handles credentials from env vars.
**Credentials**: set `TEST_EMAIL` and `TEST_PASSWORD` in `playwright/.env.staging`.

---

## [CRITICAL] Locators

- Use fallback chains: `data-testid` → `getByRole()` → `getByLabel()` → `getByPlaceholder()` → CSS
- Define locators as **getter methods** in Page Objects — **never inline in tests**
- Never use brittle nth-child or deeply nested CSS selectors
- Use `.or()` chains to cover both desktop and mobile layouts

### ❌ Anti-pattern — inline locators in test files

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — locator defined inline in test, not via POM
await page.getByTestId('dt_trade_container').first().click();
```

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT — locator defined as getter in the Page Object, used via POM in the test
await tradePage.tradeContainer.first().click();
```

**Rule**: If a `page.getByTestId(...)`, `page.locator(...)`, or `page.getByRole(...)` call appears directly in a test file, it is a violation. Move it to the appropriate Page Object getter.

---

## [CRITICAL] Assertions

- Every assertion **MUST** include a descriptive message:
    ```typescript
    await expect(element, 'Trade container should be visible after login').toBeVisible();
    ```
- **Never** write bare assertions without a message — they are forbidden
- Use semantic assertion methods (`toBeVisible`, `toHaveText`, `toHaveURL`, etc.)

---

## [CRITICAL] Credentials & Security

- **Never hardcode credentials or fallback values** — use `process.env` and fail-fast
- If `TEST_EMAIL` or `TEST_PASSWORD` is missing, throw a descriptive error
- Never use `eval()`, `Function()`, or `innerHTML` with user-controlled data
- All test emails **must** use `@webapps.mailisk.net` domain by default
- **Playwright env files live in `playwright/`** — NOT at the project root:
    - `playwright/.env.staging` — staging credentials (gitignored)
    - `playwright/.env.production` — production credentials (gitignored)
- Run: `TEST_ENV=staging npx playwright test` (defaults to staging)

---

## [CRITICAL] Env File Encryption & Decryption

Plaintext env files are **gitignored**. Encrypted `.enc` versions are committed so CI can decrypt them.

**Script** (lives in `playwright/e2e-tests-core/scripts/`):

- `env-cipher.sh <encrypt|decrypt> <staging|production>` — encrypts `playwright/.env.<env>` → `playwright/.env.<env>.enc` or decrypts the reverse

**Local usage:**

```bash
ENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-key" ./playwright/e2e-tests-core/scripts/env-cipher.sh encrypt staging
ENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-key" ./playwright/e2e-tests-core/scripts/env-cipher.sh decrypt staging
```

**CI (GitHub Actions):** set `ENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY` as a repository secret:

```yaml
- name: Decrypt Playwright env files
  env:
      ENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY: ${{ secrets.ENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY }}
  run: ./playwright/e2e-tests-core/scripts/env-cipher.sh decrypt staging
```

**Critical pitfalls:**

- ❌ Never encrypt using OpenSSL's own interactive prompt
- ❌ Never commit plaintext `playwright/.env.*` files
- ❌ Never encrypt the `.enc` file (double-encryption corrupts it)

---

## [CRITICAL] Fixtures & Page Objects

- Always use global fixtures from `playwright/fixtures/fixtures.ts` — never manually instantiate page objects in tests
- Page Object files must group methods by exactly **three** sections in this order: **Locators → Actions → Verifications**
    - **LOCATORS** — all getter properties and parameterized locator methods (top)
    - **ACTIONS** — navigation, clicks, fills, and any other user interactions (middle)
    - **VERIFICATIONS** — all `verify*` / assertion-only methods (bottom)
- To add a new page object: create in `playwright/pages/`, register in `playwright/fixtures/fixtures.ts`, then use via fixture

## [CRITICAL] One Page Object Per Route — Never Mix Page Locators

- **Every distinct route/feature gets its own Page Object** — locators for the trade form belong in `TradePage`, not `LoginPage`
- Never add locators from page B into the Page Object of page A just because the test navigates there from A
- When a test navigates to a new route and asserts on that route's content, destructure the matching page fixture in the test signature

---

## [CRITICAL] Page Object First Approach

- **Always create or update a Page Object before writing a test** — never put locators or interactions directly in test files
- Every UI interaction in a test must go through a Page Object method or getter
- If a page object does not exist for the page under test, create it first in `playwright/pages/` and register it in `playwright/fixtures/fixtures.ts` before writing the test

**Checklist before writing any test interaction:**

1. Does the Page Object already expose a getter for this element? → use it
2. If not → add the getter to the Page Object, then reference it in the test
3. Never bypass step 1 and 2 by writing the locator inline in the test

---

## [CRITICAL] Always Explore Pages with Playwright MCP Before Creating Page Objects

**Never assume the structure, flow, or locators of any page.** Before writing or updating a Page Object, you MUST:

1. **Use Playwright MCP to navigate to the page** and take a live snapshot to see the actual DOM structure, roles, and accessible names.
2. **Explore the full user flow** — many flows span multiple screens.
3. **Ask the user for context** when a page is behind authentication or requires setup data.
4. **Document what you find** — note the actual button labels, input placeholders, test IDs, and URL patterns before writing any locator.
5. **Never guess locators** — if you cannot navigate to the page, ask the user for a screenshot or DOM snapshot.

---

## [CRITICAL] Test Tags

Every `test.describe()` MUST have at least one `@feature-area` tag using the **official tag API**:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
test.describe("Trade Form", { tag: ["@trade", "@smoke", "@desktop"] }, () => { ... });

// ❌ WRONG — never put tags in titles
test.describe("Trade Form @trade @smoke", () => { ... });
```

**Feature-area tags**: `@auth`, `@trade`, `@positions`, `@reports`, `@notifications`

**Execution tags**: `@smoke` (critical path), `@regression` (full suite), `@production` (safe on prod)

**Viewport tags** (required by CI): `@desktop`, `@mobile`

---

## [CRITICAL] Test Quality

- Test names must start with **`VERIFY`** (uppercase): `'VERIFY trade form loads after login'` — never `'should ...'`
- Tests must be **fully independent** — no test should depend on another test's state
- **Never use `waitForTimeout()`** — use `expect(...).toBeVisible()` or `waitForLoadState()`
- **Never set `timeout` in `test.describe.configure()`** — use `mode` only: `test.describe.configure({ mode: "serial" })`
- **Every new test must be verified as passing** before the task is considered complete

---

## [CRITICAL] Environment Variable Validation — Always Use `beforeAll`, Never Top-Level Throws

- **Never throw at the top level of a spec file** to validate environment variables
- **Always move env var validation into `test.beforeAll()`** inside `test.describe()`

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
test.describe('Trade', { tag: ['@trade'] }, () => {
    let BASE_URL: string = undefined!;

    test.beforeAll(() => {
        const url = process.env.BASE_URL;
        if (!url) throw new Error('BASE_URL not set in playwright/.env.staging');
        BASE_URL = url;
    });
});
```

---

## [CRITICAL] Autonomous Failure Resolution & Justification

When a test fails, act as a **Quality Engineer**:

1. **Investigation First**: Use Playwright MCP to inspect the DOM. Compare actual UI vs. test intent.
2. **Logic Gate**:
    - UI contradicts requirements → **Application Bug** — fix the app
    - UI changed intentionally → **Test Maintenance** — update locators
    - Timeout/network error → **Infrastructure/Flake** — stabilize the test
3. **Mandatory Justification**: Every fix must be preceded by a `🔍 FAILURE ANALYSIS` block.
4. **No Forbidden Shortcuts**: No deletion, commenting out, or weakening assertions to make tests pass.

---

## [CRITICAL] Page Load Verification — Always Confirm New Page Is Loaded

After **every** page state change (navigation, form submit, tab switch):

```typescript
// ✅ For Deriv API-driven pages — wait for WebSocket/XHR to settle
await NavigationUtils.waitForDerivApiSettled(page);

// ✅ For trading terminal pages — assert a landmark element
await expect(tradePage.tradeContainer, 'Trade container should load').toBeVisible();
```

**Never** rely on URL change alone — always confirm with a positive element assertion.

---

## [CRITICAL] Navigation

- Use UI element clicks for in-app navigation — **NEVER** hardcode URL paths
- `page.goto()` is acceptable only for the **initial entry point** (login page, app root)
- Always navigate by clicking the actual UI element that a real user would click

---

## [CRITICAL] Test Data (DataFactory)

- Always use `DataFactory` from `../utils` (barrel via `e2e-tests-core/utils`)
- Prefer `generateEmailWithPrefix('context')` over `generateEmail()` for traceability
- **Store generated data in variables** — never call `DataFactory` twice for the same value
- **Email local part must NEVER exceed 64 characters** (RFC 5321 hard limit)

---

## [CRITICAL] Change Impact — Full Reference Check

- **Any change** (utility, page object, function signature, import path) **MUST be propagated to all references** before the task is complete
- Search the entire `playwright/` directory for every usage of the changed symbol and update them all
- After updating, verify `npx tsc --noEmit -p playwright/tsconfig.json` passes

---

## [CRITICAL] Mobile Responsive Strategy

- Use `chromium-mobile` project (Pixel 5, 500×850) — already configured in `playwright.config.ts`
- **Single describe block per spec** — runs under both desktop and mobile projects automatically
- Detect in tests: `testInfo.project.name.includes("mobile")`
- Detect in POMs: `(this.page.viewportSize()?.width ?? 1024) < 1024`
- Use `.or()` chains to cover both layouts
- Never add `(Desktop)` / `(Mobile)` suffixes to test names — the project prefix handles this

---

## [CRITICAL] Scope — Never Modify Files Outside `playwright/`

- **Never modify any file outside the `playwright/` folder** (e.g., `packages/`, `src/`, root config files)
- If a `data-testid` needs to be added to a source component, **STOP — ask the user for confirmation first**
- Tests must adapt to the app's existing DOM — use the locator fallback chain rather than modifying the app

---

## [CRITICAL] TypeScript Best Practices

- Always use **strict TypeScript** — no `any` types unless absolutely unavoidable with a comment
- Use **explicit return types** on all functions and methods
- Use `readonly` for Page Object `page` properties
- Prefer `const` over `let`; never use `var`
- Use **optional chaining** (`?.`) and **nullish coalescing** (`??`)
- Never use non-null assertion (`!`) without a comment explaining why it is safe

---

## [CRITICAL] JSDoc & Code Comments

- All **classes** must have a JSDoc comment with a usage `@example`
- All **public methods** must have JSDoc with `@param` and `@returns`
- Comments must explain **why**, not just **what**

---

## [Should] Utilities

- Only add utilities that are **actually used** — no speculative functions
- A utility belongs in `playwright/utils/` only if it is used in 2+ places
