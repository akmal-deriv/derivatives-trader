## How to Read This File

Each module section lists every documented flow with its current **status** and **priority**.

### Status Values

| Status       | Meaning                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `documented` | `flow.md` + `catalog.md` + `coverage.md` exist; no test written yet |
| `automated`  | Playwright spec file exists in `playwright/tests/` and runs in CI   |

### Priority Values

| Priority | Meaning                                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `P0`     | Blocking — must pass before any release                      |
| `P1`     | High — critical user path; implement next sprint             |
| `P2`     | Medium — important but not blocking                          |
| `P3`     | Low — nice-to-have or edge case                              |
| `N/A`    | Not automatable (e.g. SmartCharts canvas, real money trades) |

## Implementation Priority Order

| Priority | Module             | Key Flows to Implement First                                                                                               |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Now**  | `trade`            | Flow 9.7/9.8 (Deal Cancellation) + Flow 11.1/11.2 (Vanillas)                                                               |
| **Now**  | `market-selection` | Flow 9–10 (search) done — verify Flow 15–21, 24 (core tab mechanics) next, then the remaining written-but-unverified specs |
| **Now**  | `positions`        | Flow 1 (open positions mobile), Flow 2 (desktop flyout)                                                                    |
| **Next** | `reports`          | Flow 1 (page load), Flow 5 (Trade Table), Flow 6 (Statement)                                                               |
| **Next** | `notifications`    | Flow 3 (bell → dialog desktop), Flow 4 (bell → modal mobile), Flow 1 (trade banner)                                        |
| **Soon** | `automation`       | Flow 5 (resync after account switch) + G1 (already-running snackbar) + G2 (validation)                                     |
