## Section 2 — Gaps

| Gap | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Proposed spec file                                                                                                                                                                    |

| G1  | No trade parameter (Stake, Duration, Barrier, etc.) persists per tab — only `{symbol, contract_type}` is tab-scoped by architecture (`TOpenMarket`). Broader/corrected framing of the original "Stake persistence bug" (TABS-03) — file against engineering as a systemic gap, not Stake-only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `market-selection/verify-trade-tabs-param-isolation.spec.ts` (not yet written — pending a product decision on whether params SHOULD be tab-scoped)                                    |
| G2  | The active tab's chevron cue (`dt_market_tab_chevron`) — present only where the tap opens the picker (the active tab, and not while an automation run locks the strip), absent on inactive/disabled tabs — plus the `aria-haspopup="dialog"` / `aria-label` affordance on the tab root. Unit-covered in `market-tab.spec.tsx`; not yet asserted end-to-end alongside the Flow 2 replace journey it advertises. Also covers the `dt_market_tab_profit_separator` divider that sits between the cue and the inline P/L (issue #1168). | Extend `market-selection/verify-trade-tabs.spec.ts` (Flow 20's sizing test already walks the active/inactive tab split, so the cue assertion belongs there rather than in a new spec) |
