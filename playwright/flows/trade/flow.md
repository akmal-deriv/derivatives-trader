# 📋 Trade Journey Spec — What to Test

> **Purpose:** Describes the end-to-end buy + close flows for each trade type on `staging-dtrader.deriv.com`. Each dual-outcome trade type has a dedicated sub-flow per button.
>
> **Feature location:** `packages/trader/src/AppV2/Containers/Trade/` · `packages/trader/src/AppV2/Components/TradeParameters/` · `packages/trader/src/AppV2/Components/PurchaseButton/`
> **URL:** `https://staging-dtrader.deriv.com/` (trade page)
> **Authentication:** All flows start from a logged-in state (`loginPage.login()` in `beforeEach`)
> **Desktop source:** `trade-desktop.tsx` — inline trade params in a grid
> **Mobile source:** `trade-mobile.tsx` → `TradeParametersContainer` (swipeable bottom sheet)
> **Account type:** Every implemented buy flow below (Flows 2–11) runs as a `(Demo Account)` / `(Real Account)` test pair via
> `accountType: 'real' | 'demo'` on the page object's `buy*AndVerify()` method — the account created in
> `beforeAll` is real by default, and the demo variant switches in-app via `switchToAccountType('demo')`
> before configuring the trade.

## Matches/Differs

> **Structural exception — Ticks-only + no manual close:** Digit contracts support **Ticks duration only** (the duration popover has no unit-tab sidebar, just tick chips), and they **expire automatically** — there is no manual Close button. The tick duration is too short to reliably inspect the contract while open, so the flow opens the **open position's contract details right after purchase**, captures its buy reference ID, then **waits for the contract to settle in place** and verifies the **settled (closed)** contract — details page, Positions Closed tab, balance, and Reports (Trade table + Statement). The digit audit grid has **no Entry spot/Barrier** — instead a **Target** row (e.g. "Equals 5").

### Flow 5.2 — Matches/Differs: buy Differs → settle → verify closed

**Prerequisites:** Same as Flow 5.1.
**Spec:** `playwright/tests/trade/matches-differs/verify-matches-differs.spec.ts` — `VERIFY Buy "Differs" Contract (Demo Account)` / `(Real Account)`
**Unique params:** Duration (ticks), Stake (`10.00`)

The audit **Target** row reads "Over N" / "Under N". **Invalid digits:** Over cannot predict 9, Under cannot predict 0 — use a middle digit (e.g. 5), valid for both.

## Accumulators

> **Structural exception — close from trade page + auto-settle:** When an active accumulator is open, the purchase button on the trade page changes to "Close [amount] [currency]"; close is performed from the trade page directly (not the contract details footer). An accumulator can also **auto-settle** at any time — the spot hitting the **barrier** (loss) or the **take profit** (win) sells the contract, and the "Close" button reverts to "Buy". The implementation is therefore **close-reason agnostic**: it ensures the contract ends settled (manual close for 8.1; wait-for-auto-settle with a manual-close fallback for 8.2) and verifies the **settled (closed)** contract — Positions Closed tab, contract details, balance, and Reports — without asserting _how_ it closed. Because a low take profit can auto-settle within a tick or two, open-position assertions and the open-position Reports grid are **not** verified; the Take profit is instead asserted on the **trade form** before buying.

### Flow 8.1 — Accumulators without Take Profit: buy → close

## Multipliers

### Flow 9.1 — Multipliers no TP/SL: buy Up → close contract

**Prerequisites:** Authenticated with funded account. Symbol supporting Multipliers (e.g. Volatility 100 (1s) Index).
**Spec:** `playwright/tests/trade/multipliers/verify-multipliers-no-tpsl.spec.ts` — `VERIFY Buy "Up" Multipliers Contract and Close (without TP/SL) (Demo Account)` / `(Real Account)`
**Unique params:** Multiplier (`x200`), Stake (`5.40`) — NO Duration, NO TP/SL

> **Structural note:** Multipliers has no Duration param and no Barrier. The trade-page info panel shows **Stop out** (loss amount, `$N.NN`) and **Stop out level** (bare price) — Commission is not shown on the trade panel. Commission is rendered on the contract details page from the API: it is captured from the open contract details page and asserted exactly on the closed page.
>
> **Stop out capture:** `readStopOut()` stores the **numeric** amount (`20.00`), not `$20.00`. Trade params use `$N.NN`; **contract details still render Money as `-20.00 USD`**. Mobile closed Order Details "Stop out level" is asserted with `toContainText` on that numeric. On mobile, Stop out lives only in the Stake sheet — reopen it, read the rows, dismiss with **Close** (header Save stays disabled while the draft equals the committed stake).

### Flow 9.3 — Multipliers with Take Profit: buy Up → close contract

**Prerequisites:** Same as Flow 9.1.
**Spec:** `playwright/tests/trade/multipliers/verify-multipliers-with-tp.spec.ts` — `VERIFY Buy "Up" Multipliers Contract With Take Profit and Close (Demo Account)` / `(Real Account)`
**Unique params:** TP (`30.01`), Multiplier (`x160`), Stake (`10.00`), Market (`Volatility 25 (1s) Index`)

> **Implementation notes:**
>
> - TP input on mobile requires `pressSequentially` + `Tab` press to blur, then a 1500ms wait for the API response before clicking Save. The "acceptable range" hint can render from stale store state and is not a reliable guard alone — `is_api_response_tp_received_ref` must be `true` (set by API response) or `onSave()` returns early.
> - Commission is not on the trade panel. Pre-buy capture is `readStopOut()` only (Stop out amount + assert Stop out level present). Commission is captured from the open contract details page and asserted on the closed page.
> - Open positions card on mobile renders TP as `"30.01"` (no `+` prefix); desktop renders `"+30.01"`.

### Flow 9.5 — Multipliers with Stop Loss: buy Up → close contract

**Prerequisites:** Same as Flow 9.1.
**Spec:** `playwright/tests/trade/multipliers/verify-multipliers-with-sl.spec.ts` — `VERIFY Buy "Up" Multipliers Contract With Stop Loss and Close (Demo Account)` / `(Real Account)`
**Unique params:** SL (`21.10`), Multiplier (`x200`), Stake (`25.05`), Market (`Volatility 50 (1s) Index`)

> **Implementation notes:**
>
> - SL input on mobile requires `pressSequentially` + `Tab` press to blur, then wait for the "Range" hint (`slAcceptableRangeHint`) to appear, then a 1500ms wait before clicking Save. The `is_api_response_received_ref` guard must be `true` (set by API response) or `onSave()` returns early.
> - Open positions card (mobile) renders SL as `-21.10 ` (negative prefix + trailing space) — use `new RegExp('^-${stopLoss}\\s*$')` in the assertion.
> - Contract details page (mobile) verifies: trade type (`Multipliers Up`), stake (`25.05 USD`), TP badge absent, SL badge present, SL toggle `aria-pressed="true"`, SL input value (`-21.10 USD`), start time contains `buyDate`, TP/SL history section with label/value rows.

### Flow 9.7 — Multipliers with Deal Cancellation: buy Up → cancel contract

**Prerequisites:** Same as Flow 9.1. Deal cancellation available for selected symbol.
**Spec:** `playwright/tests/trade/multipliers/verify-multipliers-deal-cancellation.spec.ts` — `VERIFY Buy "Up" Multipliers Contract With Deal Cancellation and Cancel (Demo Account)` / `(Real Account)`
**Unique params:** Market (`Volatility 75 Index`), Multiplier (`x300`), DC (`5 min`); DC timer badge (`dt_deal_cancellation_badge`)

> **Structural exception:** Deal Cancellation contracts use a "Cancel [mm:ss]" button in the contract details footer — not "Close [amount] [currency]". Reports/Statement are skipped. After cancel, the Closed tab and closed contract details are verified the same way as Flow 9.1.
>
> **Buy button:** with DC active the button reads **"Total cost $N.NN"** (symbol-prefixed, no Money `dt_span`). Capture that amount before buying — it is stake + DC fee + commission, and it is what the Positions card Stake row and the balance deduction use.

## Turbos

> **Implementation note:** Turbos have no _trade-page_ (Accumulator-style) close button, but they **are early-sellable from the contract-details footer** (`isValidToSell`). The tests use a short **Minutes** duration (so the positions card shows a remaining-time countdown and `verifyContractCardDetails` works unchanged), stake **`10.50`**, verify the open position, then **close early via `ContractDetailsPage.sellContract()`** (which retries on `PriceMoved` slippage) and verify the full closed chain (Closed tab → balance-after-close → Reports). TP flows also assert the TP amount on the open contract details before closing.

### Flow 10.1 — Turbos without TP: buy Up → verify in positions

## Vanillas

> **Contract type label:** Positions and mobile contract details show the combined label (`"Vanillas Call"` / `"Vanillas Put"`). Desktop contract-details drawer shows direction only (`"Call"` / `"Put"`) — assert each surface with the label it actually renders.
