# 📋 Reports Journey Spec — What to Test

> **Purpose:** Describes the Reports feature on `staging-dtrader.deriv.com`. Defines _what_ to verify at each step.
>
> **Feature location:**
>
> - **Desktop:** `/reports` — full-page layout with `VerticalTab` sidebar (Open positions / Trade table / Statement) on the left and route content on the right
> - **Mobile:** `/reports` — `SelectNative` dropdown at the top for tab selection; same route content below
>
> **URL:**
>
> - Both: `https://staging-dtrader.deriv.com/reports` (default tab: `/reports/positions`)
>
> **Authentication:** Required — all tests start from a logged-in state
> **Note:** Reports is accessible from the desktop sidebar via `dt_sidebar_reports` (navigates to `/reports`) or from the mobile bottom nav. The shell always renders regardless of viewport — unlike Positions, there is no redirect.
