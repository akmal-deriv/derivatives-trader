# Playwright Best Practices & Skills Guide

This skill provides comprehensive patterns and reference material for writing high-quality Playwright tests in the `home-app` project. Content is split into focused resource files for efficient loading.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when:**

- Writing new Playwright tests for any feature
- Creating or updating Page Object Models
- Implementing test fixtures and utilities
- Debugging failing tests or flaky behavior
- Setting up test infrastructure and configuration
- Reviewing test code for quality and best practices

**Don't use this skill when:**

- Writing unit tests (use Jest/Vitest patterns instead)
- Making standalone API calls outside Playwright context (see `qa-mailisk-api` skill)

## Project-Specific Notes

> home-app uses `playwright/tests/` (not `tests/`) and `playwright/fixtures/fixtures.ts` as the fixture entry point.
> All output goes to `playwright/test-results/`. Env files live in `playwright/.env.staging` / `playwright/.env.production`.
> Login is **2-step** via Ory Kratos: `LoginPage` (email) → `EnterPasswordPage` (password) → `HomePage`.
> **`basePath`** is **`/dashboard`** — use full paths (or a `baseURL` that includes it) when asserting URLs. Deposit/withdraw/payment-agent and portfolio wallet UI **`data-testid`** values are listed in **`docs/web-conversion-skills/23-playwright-test-ids.md`** (e.g. `withdraw-pa-caption-limits`, `withdraw-pa-input-agent-id-status-*`; **`/withdraw/verify`** — `withdraw-verify-input-otp`, `withdraw-verify-btn-otp-help`, `withdraw-verify-dialog-otp-help`). **Transfer review modal:** the cross-currency secondary line under “You’ll receive” uses **`transfer-sheet-review-text-received-from`**; **`TransferPage.reviewReceivedFromEquivalent`** targets it (legacy alias **`reviewReceivedUsd`** still points at the same locator). **Transfer trading icons:** Quill SVGs expose **`account-icon-quill-*`** test IDs (see **`23-playwright-test-ids.md`** § Transfer). **Home total balance text:** formatted with two decimals + thousands commas — assert **`dashboard-text-total-balance`** accordingly (**`10-portfolio-wallets.md`**).
> **Quill outline `Textfield` vs `TabOrderOutlineTextfield`:** Onboarding personal details/address and profile personal details/home address wrap outline text fields with **`TabOrderOutlineTextfield`** so the `<input>` exists when empty — **`fill()`** / **`getByRole('textbox')`** work without dispatching a click on Quill’s internal `label.quill-label-lCn7V`. Other screens may still need the inner-label **`dispatchEvent('click')`** pattern; see **`flow-to-playwright`** skill and **`docs/web-conversion-skills/05-ui-design-system.md`**.
> **Home — My trading accounts:** **`dashboard-btn-deposit-{loginId}`** appears when **`isFirstDepositComplete`** is false (`src/lib/onboarding-prompt.ts`). **`HomePage.verifyRealMT5CardTradeTransferDetails`** / **`verifyRealCardTradeTransferOnly`** branch on **Transfer vs Deposit** after Trade (Cashier deposit vs transfer panel). **`cardDepositButton`** scopes to the card with **`[data-testid^="dashboard-btn-deposit-"]`** — do not use English **`hasText: 'Deposit'`** on card buttons for i18n runs. **More drawer:** **`getByTestId('more-drawer-heading-section-partnership')`** / **`download_apps`**; row buttons **`moreDrawerPartAffiliate`**, **`moreDrawerPartApi`**, **`moreDrawerDlDerivApp`**; **`verifyMorePageForReal`** / **`verifyMorePageForDemo`**. Stacked Deriv app modal: **`more-drawer-modal-deriv-app`** (**`23-playwright-test-ids.md`**).
