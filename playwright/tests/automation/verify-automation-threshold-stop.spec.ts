         * Flow 3 — configure the run so the loss threshold is the ONLY reachable stop, then verify it
         * auto-stops on its own:
         *   1. Short tick duration so contracts settle in seconds (many settle inside the window).
         *   2. High profit threshold (unreachable) + tiny loss threshold → the run can only stop on
         *      the loss threshold, never on profit. This is what makes the auto-stop deterministically
         *      a LOSS stop, so the test faithfully exercises Flow 3's risk-control path.
         *   3. Run → Running → let it reach the threshold → assert it returns to idle by itself.
         *
         * Verification approach — why we assert the durable idle state, not the notification:
         * The app shows a transient "Loss threshold reached. Automation stopped." snackbar, but it is
         * rendered with `hasCloseButton: false` and auto-dismisses after a few seconds — asserting it
         * is inherently racy (it can appear and vanish between polls). Instead we assert the DURABLE
         * outcome: the controls return to the idle Run button with no manual Stop click
         * (see `verifyLossThresholdAutoStop`). Combined with the unreachable profit threshold above,
         * a self-triggered return to idle can only mean the loss threshold fired.
