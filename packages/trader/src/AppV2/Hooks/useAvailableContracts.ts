/**
 * The trade types to offer this client, in display order.
 *
 * Starts from the static list, drops anything the native app disallows, then drops anything the
 * server says isn't tradeable: one `active_symbols` call per trade type (filtered by
 * `contract_type`), where a trade type is offered iff at least one symbol comes back for it. That
 * last step is what keeps restricted clients — EU accounts, which are offered Multipliers only —
 * from being shown trade types they cannot open, without the UI knowing anything about
 * jurisdictions.
 *
 * The availability lookup is shared through React Query (5-minute staleTime) with per-tab browsing
 * in the market selector, so it costs one round of requests rather than one per consumer. Call this
 * from something that mounts with the page, not only from inside the market selector: asking for it
 * when the selector opens makes the trade-type list render in full and then visibly collapse.
